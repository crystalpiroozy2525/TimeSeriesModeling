# TimeSeriesModeling
Time Series Modeling exhibits data through time (years, days, hours, minutes), in order to derive trends (Analytics Vidhya). R programming, a statistical computing and graphics language, was used to conduct a time series analysis and a linear regression modelfor population, impervious surfaces, precipitation, and rainfall data for the study area to observe potential challenges in flood and stormwater management. For example, an increase in impervious surfaces and rainfall can attribute to an increase in water source pollution because of stormwater runoff. A linear regression model is a statistical model that exhibits the relationship between a response variable and its explanatory variables, in order observe trends between the two variables (DataCamp). The open-sourced ggplot2 and tidyverse packages were used for data management, visualization, and statistical analysis.
